/**
 * Public, verifiable proof for the OKX.AI Genesis Hackathon submission.
 *
 * Everything here is REAL and independently checkable on-chain — no claims a
 * reviewer can't verify themselves:
 *   - the ASP identity registered on X Layer mainnet (Agent #6271),
 *   - 83 real x402 settlements on X Layer mainnet (4 featured, one per paid tool),
 *   - the on-chain showcase agent the tools return real data for (Meridian #849980),
 *   - the engineering rigor behind the scores (deterministic, unit-tested engine).
 *
 * Served free at GET /proof so anyone calling the live ASP sees the substance,
 * and cited from the README. Surfacing verifiable rigor is a deliberate answer
 * to "feels like a product, not a hackathon project."
