// ── session keys: the half that is safe, and the half this project refuses to build ──
//
// The ask was "route session-key settlements through executeInstruction with
// enforcedBy: 'session-key', backed by a persisted smart contract account per agent".
// One half of that is honest and is implemented below. The other half is not, and the
// reason is the rule at the top of this project, not a shortage of time.
//
// WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED. The AgentSpendPolicy vault already carries a session key. The human
// owner grants the agent's operator a UNIX expiry (`setSessionKeyExpiry`); `pay` reverts
// `SessionKeyExpired` past it, and `ownerPay` is deliberately exempt from that gate. So an
// AGENT-initiated vault settlement that lands while the vault carries a live expiry was
// authorised by a time-bounded session key, and saying so costs no new key: the operator
// is the same env-gated signer this path already uses. The claim is grounded on a read of
// the vault, never inferred from configuration, and it is never made about `ownerPay`.
//
// WHAT IS NOT IMPLEMENTED, AND WHY. The ERC-4337 flavour in `aa-wallet.ts` mints a fresh
// session-key private key per run and throws it away; it is never persisted anywhere. For
// this server to settle an instruction by SIGNING a UserOperation with such a key, the key
// would have to survive the request: in the database, in an env var, or in process memory
// across calls. That is autonomous key custody, which this project does not do, so it is
// not done here. The same rule blocks the "persisted smart contract account per agent": a
// Kernel account is only per-agent if its owner is the agent owner's own wallet, and then
// the session-key grant and the UserOperation are theirs to sign, not ours. The honest
// shape of that feature is client-side signing, and it does not live in this function.
//
// The vault IS the per-agent, persisted, on-chain bounded-authority account we actually
// have: `agent.vaultAddress` with `agent.vaultOperator` as its session key, both public,
// both already stored, neither of them a secret at rest.

/**
 * The session-key bound on THIS agent's vault, or a labeled reason there is none to claim.
 *
 * Never throws and never blocks a settlement. An RPC that will not answer means the
 * settlement is labeled `onchain-vault`, which is what it was labeled before this existed:
 * an infrastructure hiccup must not invent a session key, and it must not lose a payment
 * either. Only called once a settlement actually has a receipt, so the round trip is spent
 * on money that moved rather than on every attempt.
 *
 * Two gates, both with reasons rather than convenience behind them:
 *
 *  - EVM only. The Soroban AgentSpendPolicy has the same `SessionKeyExpired` refusal, but
 *    `platform/vault-adapter.ts` does not surface an expiry for it yet, so a Stellar vault
 *    settles here labeled `onchain-vault`. That is a stated gap, not a claim. The REFUSAL
 *    side is unaffected: a `SessionKeyExpired` revert is recognised whatever the chain.
 *  - The chain's signer key must be configured. Without it `policyPay` returns prepared and
 *    this path never settles for real, so there is nothing to ground a label on.
 *
 * And a deadline, because of WHERE this sits. By the time it runs the payment has already
 * moved on-chain, but the instruction has not yet been flipped to executed_onchain and the
 * TOCTOU guard still holds its id, so a read that hangs would strand a settled payment as
 * unrecorded and un-retryable. A label is worth a few seconds and not one second more.
