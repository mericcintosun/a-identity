/// @title AgentSpendPolicy
/// @notice An on-chain spending policy for an AI agent's USDC wallet on Arc.
///
/// The vault holds USDC and enforces the agent's spend policy at the contract
/// level — not on a server. The agent (the `operator`) can only move funds
/// within the rules; anything outside them reverts on-chain, verifiably, on the
/// Arc explorer. The human `owner` sets the policy, can settle an above-ceiling
/// payment they approved off-chain, can freeze all agent spending, and can
/// withdraw.
///
/// Rules enforced by `pay`:
///   - `frozen`            — when true, the agent cannot spend at all
///   - `sessionKeyExpiry`  — the agent (session key) may only pay until this UNIX time (0 = no expiry)
///   - `allowlistEnabled`  — when true, the payee must be on the allowlist
///   - `autoApproveMax`    — a single agent payment above this is rejected (0 = no ceiling)
///   - `dailyCap`          — cumulative agent spend per UTC day is capped (0 = no cap)
///
/// The `operator` is the agent's SESSION KEY: a scoped signer the human owner grants,
/// bounded by the cap/allowlist and — via `sessionKeyExpiry` — by time. When the key
/// expires the agent's `pay` reverts on-chain; the human can extend it, revoke it (set the
/// expiry to now), or settle over it with `ownerPay`. This is the bounded-authority,
/// no-human-in-the-loop-but-cannot-run-amok primitive, enforced by the contract.
///
/// All amounts are in USDC's 6-decimal ERC-20 units (e.g. $1.00 = 1_000_000),
/// matching the `payUsdcOnchain` convention in the backend. USDC on Arc is the
/// token at 0x3600...0000, exposed here through the standard ERC-20 interface.
